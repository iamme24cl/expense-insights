# Expense Tracker with AI Insights
This is a simple expense tracking web app where users can log expenses and view AI-generated insights, simulating a financial controller. It uses Django (backend) and React (frontend) to mirror the tech stack of JustPaid.ai. The backend supports storing transactions, and AI-based insights are generated using a basic Python function.
